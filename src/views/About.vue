          &emsp; Hi there! I'm Franco, thank you for visiting my page! üñ§ <br>
          <br>
          &emsp; I'm a technology enthusiast, venezuelan, currently living in Ecuador.
          Graduated from <strong>Instituto Universitario de Tecnolog√≠a Federico Rivero Palacio (IUT-FRP)</strong>
          in Venezuela as a <strong>University Superior Technician</strong> and constantly learning and
          studying online.üéì<br>
          <br>
          &emsp; I like to mess around with technology and programming in general in my free times
          and learning something new every day, for example, a new framework or a new language, or
          how to do a specific thing with some technology. I also love the Linux ecosystem in general.
          In fact, GNU/Linux is my main OS! üêß<br>
          <br>
          &emsp; Learning more and more about how our technology works is what I really like, always trying to
          find the most optimal way to do computing. Optimization is something very miss-valuated in this days, so
          I enjoy to optimize and make the code more efficient and also readable. That way, the software in general
          can be more fast, reliable, and accesible to everyone!‚öôÔ∏è
